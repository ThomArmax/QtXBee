# QtXBee
Qt API Library for use with XBee DigiMesh modems

Note that this branch is a developping branch, so unstable.
The API may change.

Currently, only XBee serie 1 and XBee serie 1 Pro are supported

This library is based on anthonypocock's work (https://github.com/anthonypocock/QtXbee), previously forked.
