 * \subsection xbee_intro_sec What is XBee
 * \cite Wikipedia
 * XBee is the brand name from <a href="http://www.digi.com/">Digi International</a> for a family of form factor compatible radio modules.
 * The first XBee radios were introduced under the MaxStream brand in 2005 and were based on the 802.15.4-2003
 * standard designed for point-to-point and star communications at over-the-air baud rates of 250 kbit/s.
 *
 * Two models were initially introducedâ€”a lower cost 1 mW XBee and the higher power 100 mW XBee-PRO.
 * Since the initial introduction, a number of new XBee radios have been introduced and all XBees are now marketed and sold under the Digi brand.
 *
 * \subsection qtxbee_intro_sec QtXBee SDK description
 * The QtXBee SDK is a Qt5 API library designed to use XBee DigiMesh modems from <a href="http://www.digi.com/">Digi</a>.
 *
 * It aims to be easy to use and very powerfull thanks to the <a href="http://www.qt.io/">Qt framework</a>.
 * It also aims to be as flexible as possible for the developer if he wants to create a library based on QtXBee, or improve it.
 *
 * With QtXBee, you will be able to configure the local XBee, communicate with remote modules, discover modules over the network ...
 *
 * \section install_sec Installation
 *
 * \code{SHELL}
 * git clone http://github.com/ThomArmax/QtXBee.git
 * cd ./QtXBee
 * qmake
 * make
 * sudo make install
 * \endcode
 * By default :
 * - Libraries will be installed in /usr/lib/QtXBee
 * - Includes will be installed in /usr/include/QtXBee
 *
 * To customize output directory, you can do :
 * \code{SHELL}
 * make install INSTALL_ROOT=<install/prefix>
 * \endcode
 * So in this case :
 * - Libraries will be installed in <install/prefix>/usr/lib/QtXBee
 * - Includes will be installed in <install/prefix>/usr/include/QtXBee
 *
 * \section getting_starter_sec Getting Started
 * Once you are done with the installation, you can go the @ref getting_started
